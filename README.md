# Roll20 Script
## Group Initiative & Combat Tracker 

This was initially created for a IRL campaign where DM was using Roll20 as a visual tool with a single monitor. 

Allows the DM to box select all character tokens and automatically roll for their intiative with the click of a button. The dexterity modifier value must be in the blue token bubble for this to work.
